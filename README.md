Solving leetcode problems for preparing interview

I will approximately reach to 200 questions. So here I have a count for this: **29 / 200**

To run each question's solution, type `node index.js` or `ts-node index.ts` in command line. ( _node or ts-node should be installed_ )

_ in the question name means that the question isn't completed yet.

TODO: 
- [ ] Should write comments for better understanding
- [ ] Should test it with proper jest settings
